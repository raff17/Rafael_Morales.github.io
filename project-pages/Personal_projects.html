          <div class="body-text">This custom flashlight was designed with portability in mind and features two modes. The first mode is a wearable flashlight that attaches to the wrist, providing hands-free illumination without limiting movement. It has three buttons on its top surface: power, modes (for different light settings), and reset (for quickly switching back to the regular flashlight mode). The second mode is the detachable lights mode, where the user can remove the three individual lights and attach them to their fingers for more precise illumination. In this project, I was responsible for the final product design and also led the design team. Additionally, I conducted failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) to ensure the design was both usable and safe.</div>

We utilized the A* algorithm for this project, which evaluates the cost of each movement by summing the cost of the previous node, the cost of the edge (movement cost), and a heuristic function. This algorithm was then integrated into a TurtleBot3 simulation on a computer running Linux and the Robot Operating System (ROS). In our simulation, we designated a target location for the TurtleBot, and the algorithm generated a path to that location, which was visualized by blue squares shown in the images.</div>
