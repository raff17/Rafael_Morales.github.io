For this project, I meticulously assembled various components through soldering, including transceivers for radio communication with a controller. I integrated a flight controller with gyroscopes and GPS to accurately determine the drone's position and compute yaw, pitch, and roll angles. Additionally, I implemented an electronic speed controller (ESC) utilizing a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to manage motor thrust based on input from the flight controller. The drone was equipped with a digital or analog camera to transmit real-time footage to the user, with the appropriate equipment used to capture the signal type. After the drone's assembly, I optimized the PID controller settings using advanced software tools.</div>
