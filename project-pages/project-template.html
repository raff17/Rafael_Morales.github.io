It utilized C++ code and a LiDAR sensor to detect the distance of objects in the environment. Based on this distance, a signal was sent to a vibration buzzer, which would either increase or decrease its vibration intensity accordingly. This setup provided users with an understanding of object proximity without being intrusive (i.e., without producing sounds).</div>
          <div class="body-text">My primary focus on this project was redesigning the case that housed the electronics for one of the Optiband models (a remote-style system) and implementing new designs based on feedback from our collaborators. This effort led to the creation of the wearable Optiband, which could be strapped to the user's wrist like a watch, allowing them to use the entire system while keeping both hands free.</div>

          <div class="project-details-content">
            <div class="body-text">GoBot was designed to promote physical movement in young children. It was developed using Python to control a TurtleBot, onto which the reward stack was mounted, and C++ to control the reward stack itself. GoBot operated by using an algorithm to track the position of an individual and move away from them, thereby encouraging physical movement. Additionally, GoBot featured three types of rewards (reward stack): lights, bubbles, and sounds, which were used to attract the attention of young children.</div>
            <div class="body-text">My primary focus on this project was split into two areas. The first was designing protective shields for the UI interface and wires. This was important because it protected the UI from liquids caused by the bubbles and kept both the wires and the interface away from children. The second area was redesigning the bubble module. Previously, the entire bubble module had to be removed to replace any damaged parts. The current design allows users to easily remove each bubble ring without having to dismantle the entire system.</div>

<div id="project-details">
  <div class="subheader-text">Occupational Thearpy mobility assisting system</div>
  <div class="project-details-content">
    <div class="body-text">This project was the main focus of my Master's thesis. It aimed to develop a teleoperated interface system that enables children with cognitive and motor impairments to use a mobile robot for performing Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), such as picking up water cups and interacting with objects and people in their environment. The project was a collaboration between the Robotics Department at Oregon State University (OSU) and healthcare experts in Occupational Therapy. We used a rapid prototyping approach to quickly and efficiently adjust the interface after each interaction with our participant.</div>
    <div class="body-text">The result of my work was an interface that utilized the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Python, allowing our participant to interact with their surroundings. The interface was built using PyQt, and a touchscreen was employed to control the robot (Hello Robot: Stretch RE2). The system collected joint data from the robot, including the positions of the arm, wrist, and gripper, as well as the base position. This data was used to create a script enabling the user to move each robot component by clicking digital buttons that corresponded to specific robot actions (e.g., move forward). The button layout underwent multiple revisions to ensure the system was as user-friendly as possible. This included replacing text with pictures representing actions and simplifying the user interface to enhance usability.</div>
    <div class="body-text">In addition to this, I designed an LED eye array that allowed the robot to express intent. This feature enabled the robot to have a gaze (i.e., move its eyes around the environment and pinpoint certain objects) and display various eye expressions (such as happy, sad, confused, and angry). This was achieved by implementing C++ to control the eye effects (gaze and expressions) and integrating it with a Python script that managed the camera's position (a camera capable of tilting and panning) mounted on the robot, facilitating the gaze functionality.</div>
